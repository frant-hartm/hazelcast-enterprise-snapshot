# Docker containers for Hazelcast Enterprise snapshots

The `Dockerfile` builds the Hazelcast Enterprise snapshot version for a Hazelcast Enterprise git branch. Snapshot images are intended for Hazelcast internal
usage and they may be changed or removed without prior notice.

Hazelcast Enterprise Snapshot images are currently based on the [Distroless Java base image](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/tree/master/java).
